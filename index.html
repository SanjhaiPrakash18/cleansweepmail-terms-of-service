    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own Google account.</p>

    <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Extension is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind. I do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>
    <p>I am not responsible for any loss of data or damages resulting from your use of the Extension.</p>
